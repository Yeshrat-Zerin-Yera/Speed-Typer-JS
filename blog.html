            <h2 class="blog-title">Difference between local storage and session storage.</h2>
            <p class="blog-body">The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data
                does not expire, whereas
                sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a
                document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Local storage
                is a more modern storage space for web pages. Its size capacity could reach up to 5MB/10MB, depending on
                browser. SessionStorage is used for storing data on the client side. Maximum limit of data saving in
                SessionStorage is about 5 MB.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title">Difference between global scope and block scope.</h2>
            <p class="blog-body">In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while
                in Node. js, it's
                controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
                statements, and the like. It's hard to completely avoid the global scope, unless you're coding purely
                functional style, but you should minimize the use of any global variables because they represent a state
                and having that defined globally makes it more vulnerable to conflicts and data corruption. You can also
                use them stand-alone with a simple begin-end curly braces {}, not
                to be confused with empty object literals.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title">How does the JavaScript event loop works?</h2>
            <p class="blog-body">JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for
                executing the code,
                collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. The event loop has one simple job â€” to
                monitor the call stack and the callback queue. If the call stack
                is empty, the event loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the call stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the event loop.</p>
